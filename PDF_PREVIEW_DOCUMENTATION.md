# PDF Preview Feature Documentation

## Overview

The PDF Preview feature has been implemented across the PaperMind platform to enhance user experience when working with PDF documents. This feature allows users to preview uploaded PDF files directly in the browser without needing external applications.

## Components

### 1. PDFPreview Component (`/components/ui/pdf-preview.tsx`)

The core component that renders PDF files in an iframe with additional controls.

**Features:**
- PDF rendering in iframe
- Zoom controls (50% to 300%)
- Toggle visibility (show/hide preview)
- Download functionality
- File information display
- Loading states and error handling

**Props:**
```typescript
interface PDFPreviewProps {
  file: File | null;
  className?: string;
  onClose?: () => void;
  showPreview?: boolean;
  onTogglePreview?: (show: boolean) => void;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced FileUpload Component (`/components/ui/file-upload.tsx`)

The original FileUpload component has been enhanced to include PDF preview functionality.

**New Props:**
- `showPreview?: boolean` - Enable/disable PDF preview (default: true)
- `previewClassName?: string` - Custom CSS classes for preview container

**Features:**
- Automatic PDF detection
- Integrated preview below file list
- Maintains all original file upload functionality

## Implementation Across Tools

The PDF preview feature has been integrated into all major tools:

### 1. CAG System (`/pages/cag-system.tsx`)
- Multi-document upload with preview
- Preview shows first uploaded PDF
- Useful for verifying document content before processing

### 2. Gap Analyzer (`/pages/gap-analyzer.tsx`)
- Single PDF upload with preview
- Allows users to verify the research paper before analysis
- Helps ensure correct document is being analyzed

### 3. Podcast Generator (`/pages/podcast-generator.tsx`)
- Research paper upload with preview
- Users can review the paper content before podcast generation
- Ensures audio content matches the intended document

### 4. Future Tools
- All new tools that require PDF uploads will automatically include preview functionality
- Simply use the enhanced FileUpload component

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
import { FileUpload } from '@/components/ui/file-upload';

<FileUpload
  onFilesChange={handleFilesChange}
  accept=".pdf"
  maxSize={10}
  placeholder="Upload PDF files"
  showPreview={true}
  previewClassName="mt-4"
/>
```

### Standalone PDF Preview
```tsx
import { PDFPreview } from '@/components/ui/pdf-preview';

<PDFPreview
  file={selectedFile}
  showPreview={true}
  onTogglePreview={setShowPreview}
  onClose={() => setSelectedFile(null)}
/>
```

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses iframe for PDF rendering
- Relies on browser's built-in PDF viewer
- Fallback handling for unsupported browsers
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Performance Considerations
- PDF URLs are created using `URL.createObjectURL()`
- Automatic cleanup with `URL.revokeObjectURL()`
- No external PDF libraries required
- Minimal bundle size impact

### Styling
- Custom CSS for consistent appearance
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design
- Material Design elevation effects
- Smooth animations and transitions

### File Size Limits
- Respects existing file size limits (default: 10MB)
- Performance optimized for typical research papers
- Large files may take longer to render initially

## CSS Classes and Styling

Custom CSS classes in `/components/ui/pdf-preview.css`:

- `.pdf-preview-container` - Main container styling
- `.pdf-viewer-container` - PDF iframe wrapper
- `.file-upload-zone` - Enhanced upload zone styling
- Dark mode variants included
- Animation keyframes for smooth transitions

## Error Handling

- Invalid file type detection
- File size validation
- PDF loading error states
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- User-friendly error messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Page Navigation**: Add next/previous page controls
2. **Search**: Text search within PDF content
3. **Annotations**: Simple annotation tools
4. **Thumbnails**: Page thumbnail navigation
5. **Full Screen**: Full-screen preview mode
6. **Print**: Direct printing from preview
7. **Multiple PDFs**: Side-by-side comparison view

## Testing

To test the PDF preview functionality:

1. Navigate to `/pdf-preview-demo` (demo page)
2. Upload any PDF file using the file upload component
3. Verify preview appears automatically
4. Test zoom controls, toggle visibility, and download
5. Try with multiple PDFs to test file selection

## Browser PDF Viewer Settings

For best user experience, ensure:
- Browser PDF viewer is enabled
- No PDF download forced (should open inline)
- JavaScript enabled for controls functionality

## Accessibility

The PDF preview component includes:
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management

## Security Considerations

- File validation before preview
- Sandboxed iframe for PDF rendering
- No direct file system access
- Client-side only processing
- Automatic URL cleanup prevents memory leaks
